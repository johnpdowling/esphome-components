# MEATER ESPHome
Adapted from .yaml file found [here](https://pastebin.com/YrEFNRHt), by [Morten Vinding](https://community.home-assistant.io/u/MortenVinding).
Make sure to quit the app on any phone / power down any block, as your meater can only connect to one device at a time. Meater MAC can be found by viewing the *esp32_ble_tracker* logs of your ESP device or by using [meaterble](https://github.com/nathanfaber/meaterble) and running the scan function.
